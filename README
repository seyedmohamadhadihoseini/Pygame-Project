Download all the files then compile and run beta.py 
Note this game was created with python 2.7.3.1 and you need to have Pygame.

Here are the rules and objective for this game: 

    If you come in contact with the enemies you die and game over.
    
    If you fall off the screen you also die.
    
    Enemies are generated randomly around the borders as time goes on. 
    
    More and more enemies will be generated to increase the difficulty.
    
    Once the number of enemies reach the limit of 12 they will stop spawning and 
    speed up instead.
    
    In 2 player mode users can revive each other by contact. Game over when both 
    players are dead.
    
    Score is based on time, the longer you survive the higher the score will be.
    
    Objective is to dodge the enemies and stay as long as possible.
    
Controls for 1 player mode are: left arrow key, right arrow key for movements 
                                and space for jump.

Controls for 2 player mode are: left arrow key, right arrow key and up arrow key 
                                for player 1. A, W and D for player 2.
                                
ENJOY! and I strongly suggest 2 player mode.
